         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>The voyce of Gods holy Spirit crying in the Wilderneſſe, prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight: Or, the ſpirit of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that is to come before the latter day,</q>
               <bibl>Malechi 4.</bibl>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg> All you that were my honeſt Chriſtian neighbours and Country people which are whole ſale Chapmen of any Trade whatſoever; but more eſpecially to you that be Ironmongers of <note place="margin">Though many of you accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me mad, (as Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 3. was thought to be poſſeſt with a divel: and <hi>Paul</hi> thought to be a mad man) am I ever the worſe for your falſe judgement, and ſlanders? But as the Lord cauſed <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lems</hi> deſtruction to be foretold by poor deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed inſtruments whom the world would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: ſo did God compel me to foretel the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of all corrupted Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and the downfal of King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. Let no man dare to judge other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies.</note> my own native Countrey: it being the Trade that God (by his over-ruling providence) ordained me, your ſervant in the Lord <hi>John Sanders,</hi> to be brought up unto from my youth, till it pleaſed my heavenly Maſter and Father in Chriſt otherwiſe to diſpoſe of me by his heavenly wiſdom: to call and compell me to goe on his meſſage both to King and Parliament, as an Herrald or Ambaſſadour from the great Kingly power and Parliament of Heaven, who hath aſſigned and ſealed to me a Commiſſion to be a forerunner and foreteller how that the Church and State muſt be rebuilded and reformed in this Land, to be a pattern and example for the whole world to follow, to learn to ſerve God with one conſent, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 39.</p>
            <p>And for proof of what I here write, it will appeare to any mans view the Holy Ghoſt hath compelled me to put out a Book called <hi>An Iron Rod put into the Lord Protectors hand, to break all antichriſtian powers in pieces; or a Diſcourſe which tends to a ſpirituall warfare with all Sects and ſelf-opinions which are the true Churches enemies, which hath its ground and foundation from Abraham, Moſes, and Chriſt, having both Law and Goſpel rule to direct every poor ſoul into the true good old way which leads to the new Jeruſalem ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate above, a pure glorious government whoſe founder and builder is God, Rev. 21. ſo that all diſſembling hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites and wilfull oppreſsors ſhall leave their evil waies, or be ſuddenly rooted out, and thoſe that have ſerved God following the good old way, ſhall ſhine as the ſtars in the firmament, and enjoy a true religious peace accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe: ſo that our true born King</hi> Charles Stuart <hi>the ſecond being reſtored, and</hi> Oliver Cromwell <hi>by the grace of God being united to him, and the ſecond under him, the Civil Magiſtracy will be a Wall to the Orthodox Church Miniſtery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Four Monarks being broken down there will be another ſet up, even the Kingly power under the Scepter of Jeſus Chriſt. Believe not thoſe Dreamers, mockers, makers of Sects, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks who write and ſpeak nothing but ſwelling words againſt dignities and the powers ordained of God: nay againſt the Lords day or Chriſtian ſabbath, and the ſacred inſtitution of Gods holy Ordinances. Take away the Candleſtick, and the light of Gods true worſhip will immediately follow. But God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deliver the poor from the ſlavery of the wicked, Pſalm 12.</p>
            <p>I tell you once again, that God hath formerly compelled me by the dictates of his holy Spirit to foretel <note place="margin">Firſt the Lord compelled me openly to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel what would befall the King and Parliament when the King was priſoner at <hi>Holmhy,</hi> witneſs Col. <hi>Graves:</hi> the manner and time of <hi>Worceſter</hi> fight: And the diſſolution of the three laſt Parliaments, witneſs Colonel <hi>Baxter,</hi> Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</hi> And of the riſing againſt the preſent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of <hi>March</hi> 1654. before it was.</note> the moſt remarkable revolutions and changes that have befaln this Nation, King, Parliament, and State, for theſe 12 yeers paſt, which God revealed to me by his holy Angel, not by dreams and fancies, but in a reall true manner, as in my book delivered to my Lord Protector, more at large appeareth. All that I have ſpoken having come to paſſe except only two things, namely the Church and State to be truly reformed, and the true born King to be reſtored. Severall things my neighbors and natural friends of Brimingham have heard me ſpeak to their great amazement, as when God compelled me to weare old clothes, and rent the ſeames, puting off my old ſhoos, and with a Carpenters rule in my hand making Proclamation by the power of God and his great Parliament of Heaven, that the Parliament that very day and hour was diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in <hi>London,</hi> being 88 miles from the City.</p>
            <p>Good friends, and honeſt neighbours, and brothers of a Trade, to you at this time I chiefly addreſſe my ſelf: What man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ought we now to be, in all godlineſs and honeſty of life, living in brotherly love one towards another!</p>
            <p>To which purpoſe I commend to you this courſe in our Trade: and firſt I ſpeake to you rich covetous and uncharitable Ironmongers of mine own native Country, and alſo to other Trades and occupations in other Countries.</p>
            <p>I am to charge you in the name of the living God whoſe workmanſhip you are that you be not highminded, or uncharitable grinding the faces of the poor, whom the Lord has promiſed to deliver for his name ſake. For all that wil not deny themſelves and leave off their wicked waies, and conform to the Image of his Son, God wil poure out his indignation on them, &amp; deſtroy them, as he did Pharaoh and all his hoſt, to the comfort of his diſtreſſed people, and deliverance of his Church. Therefore for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake your evil waies, and make your peace with God while you have time. Live no longer like ſo many <hi>Dives</hi> keeping the poor like ſo many afflicted <hi>Lazarus's.</hi> You cannot chuſe but remember that many of you were poor, but now being raiſed up in the world you have forgotten God. Remember from whence you are fallen, and repent, leſt you have no other heaven, but what you have here, but receive that dreadfull ſentence, Goe ye curſed into everlaſting perdition.</p>
            <p>Amend your lives therefore for the time to come, and live to that end God gave you a being, the generall good: give better priſes <hi>2d, in 12 d</hi> to poor workmen, that they may not have cauſe to hate you, many hundreds of them enjoying nothing but miſery and want. So ſhall the Nation be ſerved with ſerviceable ware, and you live more honeſtly and honourably then ever.</p>
            <p>Brethren and fellow ſufferers if this be not forthwith done, for the healing of your grievances, then take my counſel, let them work themſelvs: for certainly you that make the ware are the moſt, &amp; moſt conſiderable, though leaſt valued, and worſt <note place="margin">Whereas there hath been yeerly held by an old cuſtom a month for the ending of harveſt and mending of Trade, which rich men were the cauſe of for their own gain: Now, as other old cuſtomes have been altered and broken of late in this Nation, doe you alter that: and do you poor labouring Trades-men hold together, by aſſiſting and maintaining one another one fortnight or a moneth, and forbear working for the cunning Egyptian Taskmaſters now in the Spring. However take my advice, and let us have a general meeting thereupon. If we cannot gain our deſires, we wil try another way, that is, I wil draw a Petition to the Lord Protector for a Corporation, that we may make orders among our ſelves: and thoſe that have ſet up our Trade within theſe 7. or 8. yeers (not having ſerved juſt apprentiſhips) may be cald in queſtion.</note> provided for. I pray God direct us in all our undertakings, for the generall good and welfare of the Nation, and every mans juſt intereſt. Theſe being the things God hath ſet before our eyes, and put into our hearts, in which work, O Lord be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ariſe and helpe us for thy names ſake; to thy glory, and the comfort of many poor diſtreſſed people.</p>
            <p>My other book is to be ſold at the Angel in Cornhil.</p>
